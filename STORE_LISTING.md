## Description (for store listing)

**One simple thing, done well.**

I built Pip because my brain keeps procrastinating. One second I'm working, the next I'm on Twitter "monitoring the situation" or watching YouTube. Sound familiar?

So I stopped expecting willpower to save me and built this instead. When you turn it on, it blocks the websites you waste time on. Set a timer, and those sites stop loading. That's it.

**What it does:**

• Block any website — YouTube, Twitter/X, Reddit, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, you name it
• One-click toggle — No complicated settings. Just click and distractions stop
• Hold to disable — Prevents "just one quick check" moments (you know the ones)
• Flexible timers — 5 minutes to 2 hours, custom duration, or block indefinitely
• Focus stats — Track your daily, weekly, monthly focus time
• Streak tracking — See how many days you've stayed consistent
• Smart wildcards — *youtube.com blocks all subdomains, https://youtube.com blocks exact match only

**Why it's different:**

Most productivity tools are distracting themselves. This one stays quiet and gets out of the way. No gamification, no social features, no premium upsells. Just a simple blocker that works.

**Privacy:**

• No data collection — zero analytics, zero tracking
• No accounts required — works immediately
• 100% local — everything stays on your device
• Open source — see exactly what the code does

**Perfect for:**

• Remote workers avoiding social media rabbit holes
• Students studying for exams
• Anyone trying to break doom-scrolling habits
• Deep work sessions
• Digital detox

**Completely free.** No premium tiers, no hidden features, no subscriptions. I built it for myself, figured I'd share.
